# Dungeon

### Purpose of Dungeon
Now then. This is a project to get to now Java better.
I want to include JUnit-Tests, JavaDoc and at a later point a nice simple Database. 
This is done out of the purpose to have some fun during my autumn holidays.

### The first Gamer "Menace"
Menace is a simple attack and defend game. The dungeon generating will be random, so no two dungeons
will be the same. In Menace the dungeon will be square rooms that only have one door open to the
next room.
